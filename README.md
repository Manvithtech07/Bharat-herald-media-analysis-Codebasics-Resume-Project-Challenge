# Bharat-herald-media-analysis - Codebasics - Resume Project Challenge
Providing Insights to Guide a Legacy Newspaper’s Survival in a Post-COVID Digital Era
---
Project Status - In Progress

"Bharat Herald," a 70-year-old legacy newspaper. They are facing an "existential crisis". Their print circulation has been cut in half (from 1.2M to 560k) between 2019-2024. The pandemic accelerated the shift to digital, but their digital pilot in 2021 failed, costing them money and advertiser confidence.

Our mandate is to:
- Quantify what went wrong.
- Identify any potential for recovery.
- Recommend a roadmap for digital transformation
